# KLVR Charger Emulator

A 48-slot charger emulator that replicates the KLVR Charger Pro API and device behavior.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Git
- macOS or Linux

---

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/klvr-no/klvr-emulator.git
cd klvr-emulator
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Start the emulator server
- Print the active IP address the emulator is running on

Example output:
```
Resolved local IP address: 10.0.1.42
Emulator running at http://10.0.1.42:8000
```

---

## 🌐 Access the Web UI

Once running, open your browser to:
- [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Or on LAN: `http://<your-ip>:8000` (printed in terminal)

---

## 💡 Features

- Web UI showing 48 charger slots in physical layout
- Individual Insert AA, Insert AAA, and Eject controls per slot
- Simulates charging with live SoC updates
- CORS-enabled API for integration testing
- Bonjour/mDNS service broadcast (_klvrcharger._tcp.local)
- IP address printed at startup for discovery on local network

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

These endpoints simulate the KLVR Charger Pro firmware interface. All endpoints support CORS and return JSON. Designed for local testing and third-party integrations.

### Charger Status
Returns a full list of all 48 slots and their current charge state.
```
GET /api/v2/charger/status
```
Response:
```json
{
  "deviceStatus": "ok",
  "batteries": [
    { "slot": 0, "slotState": "charging", ... },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Device Info
Returns static info about the charger including firmware and network info.
```
GET /api/v2/device/info
```
Response:
```json
{
  "name": "Laddare #1",
  "firmwareVersion": "0.1.0",
  "firmwareBuild": "abc123",
  "deviceInternalTemperatureC": 24.01,
  "ip": {
    "ipAddress": "...",
    "gatewayAddress": "...",
    "mask": "...",
    "macAddress": "...",
    "method": "dhcp"
  }
}
```

### Insert Battery
Simulates inserting a battery into a slot.
```
POST /api/v2/charger/insert/{slot}?type=KLVR-AA
```
Accepted values for `type`: `KLVR-AA`, `KLVR-AAA`

### Eject Battery
Removes the battery and resets slot state.
```
POST /api/v2/charger/eject/{slot}
```

### (Planned for extension)
```
POST /api/v2/device/firmware         # Stub: accept firmware update
POST /api/v2/device/identify         # Stub: trigger blink indicator
POST /api/v2/device/network          # Stub: simulate network config
POST /api/v2/device/name             # Stub: rename device
```

These are exposed but not fully implemented.
